# 🌐 Deployment

This project can be deployed on:

- cPanel hosting (recommended for PHP)
- Nepali hosting providers supporting PHP
- Vercel/Netlify only if you remove PHP includes and convert header/footer to HTML or JS injection.

If you want, I can write a deployment guide for cPanel, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.
